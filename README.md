# zeta-Docker

This project helps you to setup zeta.

## Setup

First check this repository out. After that checkout the zeta/modigen repository. And copy it as modigen-v3 into zeta-docker or you could just adjust the docker-compose.yml and write in your own paths.

Besides these step you should also have ```docker``` and ```docker-compose``` installed.

## Usage

Just execute ```docker-compose up``` and the containers get started. When you're executing this the first time it will take very long, but after the first start it starts in reasonable time.
